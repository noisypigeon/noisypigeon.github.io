## My Answer

> The reason you're experiencing these issues is because the `List<User>` object must be initialized before use. Realm recommends declaring `List` and `RealmOptional` objects as `let` and therefore initializing them right inside the model.
> 
> In addition to that, you need to declare other properties using the `dynamic var` attribute in order for the properties to become accessors for the underlying database.
> 
> More on what I mentioned in the [Property Attributes](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#property-attributes) and [Supported Types](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#supported-types) sections of our documentation. With all that said, I recommend you change your model to the following:
> 
> ```
> import RealmSwift
> 
> class User: Object {
>     dynamic var firstName: String?
>     dynamic var lastName: String?
>     let friends = List<User>()
> }
> ```
> 
> I hope this helps and please let me know if you need anymore assistance.

## Question

Asked by “Mohshin Shah”:

> For example, I have model `class` like this
> 
> ```
> class User: Objects {
>     var firstName: String?
>     var lastName: String?
>     var friends: List<User>?
> }
> ```
> 
> and `Dictionary` like this
> 
> ```
> {
>    firstName : "Mohshin"
>    lastName : "Shah"
>    friends : [
>               {
>                firstName : "Friend 1"
>                lastName : "abc"
>                },
>               {
>                firstName : "Friend 2"
>                lastName : "def"
>                }
>               ]
> }
> ```

> I want to make a User object using the dictionary. I have tried Realm' `init(value: Any)` method and it is creating the User with flat values only but not the friends is initiated.
